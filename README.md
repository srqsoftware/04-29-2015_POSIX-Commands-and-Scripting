# POSIX Commands and Scripting by Nathan Harris on April 29, 2015 at SSEUG
Meeting agenda: http://srqsoftware.github.io/04-29-2015_POSIX-Commands-and-Scripting/


## Abstract 
Shell scripting provides a rich set of capabilities for automating tasks. 
Often, a simple shell script can take the place of a far more complex program written in a traditional programming language. 
This presentation will help developers understand the pros and cons of POSIX scripting, and will describe best practices for incorporating them within software projects.
